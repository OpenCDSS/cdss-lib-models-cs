# cdss-lib-models-cs #

This repository contains [Colorado's Decision Support Systems (CDSS)](https://www.colorado.gov/cdss)
C# library for StateMod and StateCU models.
One repository is used for both models because there is overlap in file formats and internal data structures
These packages are used by CDSS StateMod C# applications and other C# libraries.

**This code is experimental and is used in support of the experimental
[StateMod C#](https://github.com/OpenCDSS/cdss-app-statemod-cs) code.**

## Repository Folder Structure ##

The following are the main folders and files in this repository, listed alphabetically.
See also the [Development Environment Folder Structure](#development-environment-folder-structure)
for overall folder structure recommendations.
**This structure needs to be completely described when the experimental C# StateMod code is functional.**

```

  .git/                       Git repository folder (DO NOT MODIFY THIS except with Git tools).
  .gitattributes              Git configuration file for repository.
  .gitignore                  Git configuration file for repository.

## Development Environment Folder Structure ##

The following folder structure is recommended for software development.
Top-level folders should be created as necessary.
Repositories are expected to be on the same folder level to allow cross-referencing
scripts in those repositories to work.
StateMod C# is used as an example, and normally use of this repository will occur
through development of the main CDSS applications.
See the application's developer documentation for more information.

```
C:\Users\user\                               Windows user home folder (typical development environment).
/home/user/                                  Linux user home folder (not tested).
/cygdrive/C/Users/user                       Cygdrive home folder (not tested).
  cdss-dev/                                  Projects that are part of Colorado's Decision Support Systems.
    StateMod-CS/                             StateMod C# product folder (will be similar for other applications).
-------------- below here folder names should match exactly -----------------
      git-repos/                             Git repositories for StateMod C#.
        cdss-lib-cdss-cs/                    CDSS shared code repository.
        cdss-lib-common-cs/                  Shared code repository.
        cdss-lib-models-cs/                  Model code repository.
        cdss-app-statemod-cs/                StateMod C# code.
```

## Version ##

A version for the library is typically not defined.
Instead, tags are used to cross-reference the library version with commit of application code such as StateMod C#.
This allows checking out a version of the library consistent with an application version.
This approach might need to change if the library is seen as an independent resource that is used by many third-party applications.

## Development Environment ##

The following tools are required to be installed in the development environment.
See more information in the
[StateMod C# Repository Development Environment](https://github.com/OpenCDSS/cdss-app-statemod-cs#development-environment)
documentation.

## Code Generation  ##

The C# code in this repository was auto-generated using the
[cdss-lib-common-java](https://github.com/OpenCDSS/cdss-lib-models-java) Java library as input and the
[Tangible Software Solutions](https://www.tangiblesoftwaresolutions.com/product_details/java_to_csharp_converter.html) Java to C# Converter.
The converter was used to interactively convert the input `src` folder with the following options:

1. Accept default conversion options other than exceptions below.
2. ***Options / Miscellaneous Options**
	* Uncheck ***Convert methods to properties if preceded by `get` or `set` (and optionally `is)***.
	This will ensure that C# code is more similar to original Java code.
	* Uncheck ***Convert generic type arguments of Java `wrapper` types (e.g., Integer) to primitive types.***
